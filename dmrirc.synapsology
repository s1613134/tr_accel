# This file contains commands that will be run by trac-all before an analysis.
# It is used to set all parameters needed for the analysis.
#
# Remove a parameter from your dmrirc file if you want use the default value.
# Parameters that don't have default values must be specified.
#
# Any other commands that you might want to run before an analysis can be added
# to this file.

# pathway distributions looks like a single curve. This is a sign that the

# between the individual and the atlas. Setting the reinit parameter to 1 and
# rerunning "trac-all -prior" and "trac-all -path", only for the specific
# subjects and pathways that had this problem, will attempt to reconstruct them
# with a different initial guess.
