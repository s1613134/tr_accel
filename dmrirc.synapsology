# This file contains commands that will be run by trac-all before an analysis.
# It is used to set all parameters needed for the analysis.
#
# Remove a parameter from your dmrirc file if you want use the default value.

# Any other commands that you might want to run before an analysis can be added

# use -s option

# Input diffusion DICOMs (file names relative to dcmroot)
# If original DICOMs don't exist, these can be in other image format
# but then the gradient table and b-value table must be specified (see below)
#

# Diffusion gradient table (if using the same one for all scans)
# Must be specified if it cannot be read from the DICOM headers
# The table must have either three columns, where each row is a gradient vector
# or three rows, where each column is a gradient vector
# There must be as many gradient vectors as volumes in the diffusion data set
# Default: Read from DICOM header
